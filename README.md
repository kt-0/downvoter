# downvoter

This originally started as a simple script that would downvote all posts on what ever reddit page you were currently on.

Has built in delay between votes (to seem more human)

Also wanted to add the ability to go to the next page and this is where a simple script (that works) turned into a Chrome Extension (not sure if it currently works)

I have an updated version locally which has some additional basic features (slightly randomized time between clicks, number of pages/posts to downvote) but as far as I remember it isn't working or there were issues with the "next page" functionality
